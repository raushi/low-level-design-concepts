/*
ðŸ§  Prototype Design Pattern â€“ Overview
    The Prototype Pattern is used when creating an object is expensive (time/memory),
    and we want to avoid building it from scratch every time.
    Instead, we:
        Create a base object (prototype),
        Clone it when a new similar object is needed,
        Then customize the clone if necessary.
âœ… Benefits:
    Speeds up object creation
    Useful for objects with many configuration options
    Keeps instantiation logic clean
