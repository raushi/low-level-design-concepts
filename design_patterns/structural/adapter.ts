/*
âœ… Adapter Pattern â€“ Overview
    Intent:
        Allow incompatible interfaces to work together by introducing an adapter that bridges the gap.

    ðŸ§© Real-World Analogy
        Imagine a laptop charger with a USB-C connector, but the wall socket only accepts a 3-pin plug. 
        You use an adapter that converts the 3-pin socket to USB-C. 
        The charger and wall socket are incompatible directly, but the adapter makes them compatible.
