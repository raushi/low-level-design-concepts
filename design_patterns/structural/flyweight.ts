/*
ðŸ§  Flyweight Pattern â€” Quick Intro
    The Flyweight Pattern is used to minimize memory usage by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects. 
    It's particularly useful when:
        You have a large number of objects.
        Many of them share common, intrinsic (unchanging) data.

ðŸŽ¯ Real-World Analogy
    Think of a text editor. Each character (a, b, c, etc.) has:
        Shared intrinsic data â†’ font, size, style (stored once).
        Unique extrinsic data â†’ position in the document (stored separately).
    Instead of creating a separate object for every character, the editor reuses shared glyphs.
