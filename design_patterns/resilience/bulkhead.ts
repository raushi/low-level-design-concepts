/*
    ðŸ§± Bulkhead Pattern â€“ Overview
    - The Bulkhead pattern is a resilience design pattern that isolates components or resources into independent compartments,
        so a failure in one does not cascade to others.
    - This is inspired by bulkheads in a shipâ€”watertight walls that prevent flooding in one compartment from sinking the whole vessel.

    ðŸ§  Real-World Analogy
    - Imagine a ship divided into separate sealed compartments:
    - If one compartment floods, the others remain dry.
    - This prevents total failure due to localized damage.
    - In software:
        - Think of isolating requests by service, customer type, or function.
        - If one component (like file uploads) fails, it wonâ€™t take down login or search functionality.

    âœ… Why Use It?
    - Prevent resource exhaustion.
    - Contain failures to a single service or operation type.
    - Increase fault tolerance and graceful degradation.
