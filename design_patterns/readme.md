# ðŸ”· What are Creational Patterns?

**Creational patterns** are a category of design patterns in object-oriented programming that deal with object creation mechanisms.  
Their main goal is to **create objects in a manner suitable to the situation**, often handling complexity or enforcing constraints (like only one instance).

These patterns **abstract the instantiation process** and help make a system **independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented**.

## Common Creational Patterns:

### ðŸ”¹ Singleton
Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.  
ðŸ”§ **Use when**: Only one object is needed to coordinate actions (e.g., configuration manager, logging).

### ðŸ”¹ Factory Method
Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.  
ðŸ”§ **Use when**: You want the client to delegate instantiation to subclasses.

### ðŸ”¹ Abstract Factory
Produces families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.  
ðŸ”§ **Use when**: You want to enforce consistency among products from the same "family".

### ðŸ”¹ Builder
Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.  
ðŸ”§ **Use when**: You need to create complex objects with many optional parts.

### ðŸ”¹ Prototype
Creates new objects by copying an existing object (a prototype), rather than creating from scratch.  
ðŸ”§ **Use when**: Object creation is expensive, and copying is more efficient.

# ðŸ”· What are Structural Patterns?

**Structural patterns** are design patterns in object-oriented programming that deal with **how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures**.  
These patterns focus on simplifying relationships between entities, enabling flexibility and reuse.

They help ensure that if one part of a system changes, the rest of the system remains unaffected, promoting **loose coupling** between components.

## Common Structural Patterns:

### ðŸ”¹ Adapter
Converts the interface of a class into another interface the client expects.  
ðŸ”§ **Use when**: You want to integrate classes with incompatible interfaces without changing their code.

### ðŸ”¹ Decorator
Adds new functionality to an object dynamically without altering its structure.  
ðŸ”§ **Use when**: You want to add responsibilities to objects at runtime.

### ðŸ”¹ Proxy
Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.  
ðŸ”§ **Use when**: You want to add access control, lazy loading, logging, or caching.

### ðŸ”¹ Composite
Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.  
ðŸ”§ **Use when**: You want clients to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.

### ðŸ”¹ Facade
Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.  
ðŸ”§ **Use when**: You want to make a subsystem easier to use by hiding internal complexity.

### ðŸ”¹ Bridge
Decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.  
ðŸ”§ **Use when**: You want to avoid a permanent binding between an abstraction and its implementation.

### ðŸ”¹ Flyweight
Reduces the cost of creating and manipulating a large number of similar objects.  
ðŸ”§ **Use when**: You want to efficiently support large numbers of fine-grained objects.

Structural patterns are key to building **flexible, maintainable**, and **scalable** software systems by focusing on how objects are connected and interact.
