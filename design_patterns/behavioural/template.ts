/*
ðŸ’¡ Template Method Pattern
    The Template Method Pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm
    in a base class but lets subclasses override specific steps
    of that algorithm without changing its structure.

ðŸ‘‡ Real-world Analogy
    Consider making a cup of tea or coffee:
        Boil water â†’ pour in cup â†’ add coffee or tea â†’ add milk/sugar (optional)
        The steps are similar, but specific parts (e.g. adding ingredients) differ.
        You can define the process once and vary the details.

ðŸ§± Key Components
    Abstract Class with a template method() that defines the sequence of steps.
    Concrete Subclasses that override specific steps.
