/*
ðŸ§© Strategy Pattern Overview
    The Strategy Pattern allows you to define a family of algorithms,
    encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.
    It lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.

ðŸ’¡ Real-World Analogy
    Think of a navigation app that allows you to choose between different route strategies:
        Fastest Route
        Shortest Route
        Scenic Route
    You can switch the route-finding algorithm without changing the core app.
