// Single Responsibility Principle
// A class should have only one responsibility

/*
    Requirements:
        You have a Report that:
            Contains a title and a content.

    You need to:
        Create/generate a report (business logic)
        Print the report (display it nicely)
        Export the report to a PDF (simulate it â€” no real file needed)
    
    ðŸŽ¯ Task:
        Design classes so that:
            Report creation logic is separate
            Report printing logic is separate
            Report exporting logic is separate
        Apply Single Responsibility Principle:
            Each class should have only one reason to change.
*/

/*
    Polymorphism is a fundamental object-oriented programming (OOP) concept 
    that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a 
    common type, enabling flexible and extensible systems.
    This means you can define a single interface and have multiple implementations, 
    allowing different classes to respond to the same method call in their own specific ways.

// Usage:

const report = new ReportGeneration("Monthly Sales", "Sales increased by 20% compared to last month.");

// Create the concrete printer and exporter
const htmlPrinter = new HTMLReportPrinter();
const pdfExporter = new ReportPDFExporter();

// Inject dependencies and use the system
const reportService = new ReportService(htmlPrinter, pdfExporter);

reportService.printReport(report);  // Prints in HTML format
reportService.exportReport(report);  // Exports to PDF

// Later, you can swap to different classes without modifying ReportService:
const wordExporter = new ReportWordExporter();

const reportService1 = new ReportService(htmlPrinter, wordExporter);
reportService1.exportReport(report);  // Exports to Word now
